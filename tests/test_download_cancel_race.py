"""Regression tests for the cancel/completion race in _run_download.

A user can hit cancel just as a download finishes: the last progress callback
already ran (so no DownloadCancelledError was raised mid-flight), but the
cancel route has flipped the DB row to "cancelled" and armed the in-flight
flag.  The old success branch ignored both signals and either marked the task
success or left a "success" attempt + an "ok" notification behind.  The branch
now re-checks the row status and the flag inside its transaction and raises
DownloadCancelledError so the shared cancel-cleanup path (temp dir, flag, no
"ok" notification) runs.
